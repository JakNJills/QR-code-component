## Overview 
-My overview is that this would be a simple html/css build that wouldn't take much time at all.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
- Build a container div
- Added image and two paragraph elements
- Moved attributions to bottom
- used background colors to map out where each element ss placed.
- styling page to match display image
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am gaining a better understading in the CSS aspect of this project versus the HTML. Most of the elements were already provided in the HTML but all the CSS is styling I had to do of my own. I gained a much better understanding of padding, margins, and borders. I also learned to use different measurements to achieve the sizes of different elements.

--Getting this measurements current is what I have to say I'm more happy about. It took the longest but figuring it out on my own make me so happy.
```css
  .firstMsg {
    font-weight: 700;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);  
    margin-bottom: 5%;
    font-size: .58rem;
    border: 0;
  }

  .secondMsg {
    font-weight: 400;
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    font-size: 0.40rem;
    border: 0;
    margin-top: 2%;
    margin-bottom: 14px;
    padding: 0;
  }
```

### Continued development

I still need development in all areas. I have learned through many blogs, youtube videos, tweets, linkedin post, etc.. that the learning process is never done. I can say that I have gained some confidence in my ability which builds my need to complete more projects.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://designforhackers.com/blog/justify-text-html-css/) - This article helped me understand why using justify content wasn't a good choice. I struggled with getting the word-spacing, margins, and letter-spacing to work with the justify align property. Reading this ordered opened up my eyes as to why.
- [resource 2](https://supersimple.dev/courses/html-css-course) - The box model portion of this video truly helped me understand calculating width and height. I use the background-color method to visualize exactly how much room my content would take up in each element.

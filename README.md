### What I learned

I am gaining a better understading in the CSS aspect of this project versus the HTML. Most of the elements were already provided in the HTML but all the CSS is styling I had to figure out on my own. I gained a much better understanding of padding, margins, and borders. I also learned to use different measurements to achieve the sizes of different elements.

--Getting this measurements current is what I have to say I'm more happy about. It took the longest but figuring it out on my own make me so happy.

```css
  .firstMsg {
    font-weight: 700;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);  
    margin-bottom: 5%;
    font-size: .58rem;
    border: 0;
  }

  .secondMsg {
    font-weight: 400;
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    font-size: 0.40rem;
    border: 0;
    margin-top: 2%;
    margin-bottom: 14px;
    padding: 0;
  }
```

### Continued development

I still need development in all areas. I have learned through many blogs, youtube videos, tweets, linkedin post, etc.. that the learning process is never done. I can say that I have gained some confidence in my ability which builds my need to complete more projects.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://designforhackers.com/blog/justify-text-html-css/) - This article helped me understand why using justify content wasn't a good choice. I struggled with getting the word-spacing, margins, and letter-spacing to work with the justify align property. Reading this ordered opened up my eyes as to why.

- [resource 2](https://supersimple.dev/courses/html-css-course) - The box model portion of this video truly helped me understand calculating width and height. I use the background-color method to visualize exactly how much room my content would take up in each element.
